            <h3>It makes you laugh</h3>
            <p>In this project, you'll write code across a handful of <span class="accent">HTML and CSS</span> files.
                Note that it's very important that you plan your project before you start writing any code!
                Break your project down into small pieces of work and strategize your approach to each one. With
                these
                bite-sized amounts,
                it'll be easier to debug and fix any issues that appear.
                Feel free to implement your own design workflow, but if you get stuck -- here is a brief primer to
                get
                you up and running!
